        Hello! My name is NOT Ronnie Veillon, ITS NOT and I am studying accounting at Western Washington University in my third year. I regurly attend Beta Alpha Psi meetings and am working on becoming a member and hope to earn a leadership role within the club. I have work experience as a Legal Intern at a local law firm in Seattle, and I am skilled in software systems like microsoft excel and SAP ERP.

         On my own time, I like to rock climb and play chess. I have attended many chess tournaments hosted by WWU, and hope to enter the Bellingham open in April. I am also learning to climb with ropes, and hope to take my skills outside this summer.
